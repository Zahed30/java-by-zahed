## 📅 Java Day 1 – Variables, User Input, Arithmetic Operators

This repo contains basic Java programs that demonstrate:

- Declaring and printing variables and data types
- Taking input from the user using `Scanner`
- Performing arithmetic operations

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `basic.java`     | Shows different data types                          |
| `User1.java`     | Reads user input from the console                   |
| `Arithmetic.java`| Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus |


## 📅 Java Day 2 – If-Else, Nested If-Else, Switch, Ternary Operator

This day covers Java conditional control structures:

- `if-else` statement
- Nested `if-else` logic
- `switch` statement for multi-way decisions
- Ternary operator for compact conditions

## 📅 Java Day 3 – Loops, Switch, Break, Nested Loops

This day focuses on Java looping constructs and flow control within loops:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop
- `switch` with break statement
- Nested loops for pattern-based or multi-level logic

## 📅 Java Day 4 – Mini Projects: Random Guessing Game & Dice Roller 🎮🎲

Today I built two beginner-friendly mini projects to apply core Java skills:

### Concepts Practiced:
- `Random` class from `java.util` for number generation
- `Scanner` class for user input
- `if-else`, break, and replay mechanics

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `RandomGuess.java` | A guessing game where the user has limited chances to guess a randomly generated number |
| `diceroller.java`  | Simulates a dice roll, giving a random number between 1 and 6 |

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Applied real logic with conditions and loops
- Understood how to write interactive CLI-based Java programs
- Built confidence through hands-on mini projects
