## 📅 Java Day 1 – Variables, User Input, Arithmetic Operators

This repo contains basic Java programs that demonstrate:

- Declaring and printing variables and data types
- Taking input from the user using `Scanner`
- Performing arithmetic operations

## 📅 Java Day 2 – If-Else, Nested If-Else, Switch, Ternary Operator

This day covers Java conditional control structures:

- `if-else` statement
- Nested `if-else` logic
- `switch` statement for multi-way decisions
- Ternary operator for compact conditions

## 📅 Java Day 3 – Loops, Switch, Break, Nested Loops

This day focuses on Java looping constructs and flow control within loops:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop
- `switch` with break statement
- Nested loops for pattern-based or multi-level logic
